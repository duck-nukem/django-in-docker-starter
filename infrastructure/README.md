From the project root run

```bash
./infrastructure/bin/deploy_local.sh
```

This will deploy the infrastructure to a local node.

**TODOs:**
- [ ] Add cross-platform local node deployment (or defer it to the user)
- [ ] Instead of locally building containers pull them from a repository
- [ ] Add a way to deploy to a remote node
